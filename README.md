Renux OS is a complete Unix-like operating system written in Rust. This project aims to provide a hybrid kernel that can be extended with additional features as needed. The main focus is to learn and explore developing an operating system in Rust.

## Features [In planning]

- [X] **Written in Rust**: Leveraging the safety and concurrency features of Rust.
- [ ] **Hybrid Kernel**: Combines elements of both monolithic and microkernel designs.
- [X] **Scripts directory**: Create and manage Renux easily
- [ ] **C and C++ languages**: Add tools and drivers in C and C++ to communicate directly on hardware
- [X] **Bootable Image**: Create a bootable image using `cargo bootimage`.
- [X] **QEMU Support**: Test your OS in a virtual environment using QEMU.

## Development Status
> [!WARNING]
> Renux OS is currently in the development phase. Many features are still being implemented and tested. Contributions and feedback are welcome to help improve and expand the project.
