# UNIX_OS
This is a basic structure for a UNIX-like operating system.

## Directories
- `bin`: Essential binaries
- `sbin`: System binaries
- `lib`: Shared libraries
- `etc`: System configuration files
- `dev`: Device files
- `proc`: Virtual filesystem for process information
- `sys`: Virtual filesystem for kernel information
- `tmp`: Temporary files
- `usr`: User binaries and libraries
- `var`: Variable data like logs and caches
- `home`: User home directories
- `root`: Home directory for the root user
- `boot`: Bootloader and kernel files
- `mnt`: Mount points for temporary mounts
- `media`: Mount points for removable media
- `kernel`: Directory for kernel-specific files

## Usage
This structure serves as a foundation for developing a custom UNIX-like operating system.
